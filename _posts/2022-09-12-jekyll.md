I created this portfolio website as a way to display the various programming projects I have worked on. My intention is that prospective employers may be able to get an idea of my skills and knowledge.

This page is a meta post, describing the process of building the site using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Jekyll is a ruby-based framework for building static sites. It seemlessly integrates with GitHub Pages, which is a free hosting service that allows GitHub users to host repos as websites.

### Installation

I started by installing ruby, gem and Jekyll, with the help of the Jekyll [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/). (I am using a Mac, so Homebrew is also required, though I already had it installed before this project.)
```bash
# install ruby version manager and installer
brew install chruby ruby-install

# install ruby
ruby-install ruby

# configure shell to use chruby
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "chruby ruby-3.1.2" >> ~/.zshrc 

# install Jekyll
gem install jekyll
```
I found [this theme](https://github.com/midzer/urban-theme), which I forked on Github and renamed julian-del.github.io. This allows me to use the repo as the basis for a Github Pages portfolio site.

I cloned the repo to my desktop and initialised git. 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:julian-del/julian-del.github.io.git
```
Next, I updated the \_config.yaml file:
``` yml
# Site settings
title: Julian’s Cybersecurity Portfolio
email: j [at] juliandelorenzo.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  A simple portfolio website for Julian’s cybersecurity and programming projects.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "julian-del.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
  # twitter_username: 
github_username:  julian-del

# Build settings

```
After installing some required dependencies using `bundle update`, I built the site:

In order to display proper code syntax highlighting in posts, I downloaded the [Default](https://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/ruby.html) Pygments theme. I added the css file to the `css` folder in my Jekyll project. I then needed to add the new file into `main.scss`:
```css
@import "pygments.css";
```
