I created this portfolio website as a way to display the various programming projects I have worked on. My intention is that prospective employers may be able to look through the site to get an idea of my skills and knowledge.

This article is a bit of a meta post, describing the process of building the site itself, using Jekyll and GitHub Pages. Jekyll is a ruby-based framework for building static sites. It natively integrates with GitHub Pages, which is a free hosting service that allows GitHub users to host repos as websites.

### Installation
I started by installing ruby, gem and Jekyll on my machine, with the help of the Jekyll [docs](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/). (I am using a Mac, so Homebrew is also required, though I already had it installed before this project.)
```bash
# install ruby version manager and installer
brew install chruby ruby-install

# install ruby
ruby-install ruby

# configure shell to use the chruby version manager
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/chruby.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "source $(brew --prefix)/opt/chruby/share/chruby/auto.sh" >> ~/.zshrc
echo "chruby ruby-3.1.2" >> ~/.zshrc 

# install Jekyll
gem install jekyll
```
I found [this theme](https://github.com/midzer/urban-theme), which I forked on Github and renamed *julian-del.github.io*. This naming formate allows me to use the repo as the basis for a GitHub Pages portfolio site.

Before I could clone the repo to my machine, I needed to create an SSH key pair to authenticate my GitHub account and allow me to push remote changes to my repos. I followed the GitHub [docs](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent) and used `ssh-keygen` and `ssh-agent` to generate an Ed25519 key, which I then added to my GitHub profile.

Next, I cloned the Jekyll theme repo to my local machine and initialised git: 
```bash
git clone git@github.com:julian-del/julian-del.github.io.git
```
### Customisation
To start making the site my own, I updated the `_config.yaml` file to include my site's details. This is the file Jekyll uses to define the basic meta data for the site:
``` yml
# Site settings
title: Julian’s Cybersecurity Portfolio
email: j [at] juliandelorenzo.com
description: > # this means to ignore newlines until "baseurl:"
  A simple portfolio website for Julian’s cybersecurity and programming projects.
baseurl: "" # the subpath of your site, e.g. /blog
url: "julian-del.github.io" # the base hostname & protocol for your site
  # twitter_username: 
github_username:  julian-del

# Build settings
markdown: kramdown
permalink: pretty
```
After installing some required dependencies using `bundle update`, I built the site locally for the first time using `bundle exec jekyll serve`:

After some playing around with a draft post, I realised I did not like how code was rendered in the code blocks in the Jekyll theme. So in order to display code syntax highlighting, I downloaded the [Default](https://jwarby.github.io/jekyll-pygments-themes/languages/ruby.html) Pygments theme and added the CSS file to the `css` folder in the project directory. I then needed to add the new file into `main.scss` in order for Jekyll to pick it up:
```css
@import "pygments.css";
```
To finish the initial setup of the site, I added a header image that will be visible on all pages – a photo of a meandering river that I took myself:

The process of putting this portfolio together was extremely satisfying. I improved my abilities at using various languages and frameworks – bash, HTML, CSS, ruby, Jekyll and GitHub. I also used Vim and git from the command line. These latter two tools are massive time savers, once you take the time to learn how to use them.
