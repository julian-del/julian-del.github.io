I thought it would be interesting to track the price of bitcoin in different national currencies over time. In particular, I wanted a way to quickly see when the last all-time high (ATH) price occurred in a given currency, and compare that ATH with the current price. Most of the time, all national currencies move in the same way against bitcoin. But sometimes, my spreadsheet will show a national currency that is performing less well than others against bitcoin. In the last couple of years, examples of countries whose currencies have suffered severe devaluation include Lebanon, Venezuela and Argentina.

### The Script
I used the CoinGecko API to access price data, the Google Sheets API to update a public spreadsheet, and AWS Lambda to automate the script to run every 30 minutes.

The script starts by importing necessary libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd # data manipulation
from datetime import datetime,timezone 
import gspread # interacting with Google Sheets API
from pycoingecko import CoinGeckoAPI
import os
import logging
```
I then set up a logging tool that was helpful when debugging, and set a variable for the CoinGecko API:
```python
logger = logging.getLogger()
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
cg = CoinGeckoAPI()
```
Next, I define the function that AWS Lambda will run (I will explain the `event` and `context` arguments later on):
```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # Establish credentials with my Google account:
    gc = gspread.service_account(filename='client_secret.json')
    # Open the existing Google Sheet:
    sh = gc.open("Bitcoin Versus")
    sh = sh.sheet1
```
The script now downloads from the G Sheet only the necessary cells (i.e., no headers or sidebar notes): 
```python
    # Convert G Sheet cells to pandas dataframe:
    df = pd.DataFrame(sh.get('B3:F48'))
    
    # Create a list of currency codes to query:
    currencies = list(df[0])
    logger.debug('made list of currencies')
    
    # pass the list of all currency codes in column C of the G Sheet to the CoinGecko API:
    logger.debug('trying to get cg data')
    prices = cg.get_price(ids='bitcoin', vs_currencies=currencies)
    logger.debug('got cg data')
    
    # compute today's date
    time = datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S %Z')
    date = datetime.now(timezone.utc).strftime('%Y:%m:%d')
    
    # update dataframe with new prices
    df[1] = prices['bitcoin'].values()	
```
Next, I Compare the latest prices to each currency's ATH:
```python
    prices = df[1]
    i = 0
	
	# Loop through all currencies:
	for price in prices:
        ATH = df.at[i,2]
        ATH = ATH.replace(',','')
        ATH = float(ATH)
        
    	# Compare current_price to ATH:
        if price > ATH:
            ATH = price
            # If new ATH, update ATH value in dataframe:
            df.at[i,2] = ATH
            # Calculate % change from ATH:    
            pc = ((price - ATH) / ATH) * 100
            pc = f"+{pc}"
            # Update ATH cell in dataframe:
            df.at[i,4] = pc
            # If ATH is updated, update 'Date of ATH' cell in dataframe:
            df.at[i,3] = date
            
        elif price < ATH:
            # calculate % change from ATH    
            pc = ((price - ATH) / ATH) * 100
            # update cell in dataframe
            df.at[i,4] = pc
        
        i += 1
```
Finally, the script sends the updated table back to the Google Sheet:
```python
    # Update G Sheet by first converting dataframe values to a list:
    update = sh.update('B3:F48', df.values.tolist())
	
    # Update 'prices last updated' cell in the G Sheet:
    sh.update('E1', time)
```

### AWS Lambda
Lambda is an AWS service that lets you run code without having to deal with servers: you just give Amazon your code and they deal with everything. There is a generous free tier, so I do not pay anything to have this script running.

A Lambda function is triggered by an `event`, which could be many things, including signals from IoT devices, git commits or emails:

For my Lambda function, I used an EventBridge trigger, allowing me to set the function to run every 30 minutes:

### Conclusion
I loved designing and building this project. It took many hours of debugging â€“ both to write the initial script, and then to get it working properly with AWS. I learned how to interact with various APIs, including best practice on how to deal with private keys and login credentials. I also developed my python scripting abilities and learned to use AWS Lambda. I am now much more confident to take on new projects in areas I don't have experience in. The incremental trial and error approach of programming is satisfying and a lot of fun.
